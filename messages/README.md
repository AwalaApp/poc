# Relaynet Abstract Message Format (RAMF) library

Parcels and cargoes are serialized using the Relaynet Abstract Message Format (RAMF). Such messages can be represented with the data structures provided by this library ([`index.js`](index.js)), as well as serialized and deserialized ([`serialization.js`](serialization.js)).

In the eventual production-ready implementation, this would be a standalone library published on NPM.
